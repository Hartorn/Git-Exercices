Everything was working fine, but there is a bug in production.
You can reproduce it, but impossible to determine what is causing this.
test.sh should return OK, but it is returning KO.

Hopefully, you know that tag 1.0.0 is working fine.

You need to determine what is the first commit causing this bug, to understand this bug.
